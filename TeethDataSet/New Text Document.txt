Project Summary

Dataset: Dental images dataset (Teeth Dataset).

Preprocessing:

Rescaled all images to [0,1].

Applied Data Augmentation (rotation, zoom, shift, brightness adjustment, flipping) to increase dataset diversity and improve generalization.

Model (CNN):

Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch using TensorFlow/Keras.

Architecture includes Conv2D, MaxPooling, and BatchNormalization layers for feature extraction.

Added Dropout and L2 regularization to reduce overfitting.

Output layer matches the number of classes (7 classes).

Training:

Used Adam optimizer and Categorical Crossentropy loss.

Applied EarlyStopping and ReduceLROnPlateau to monitor validation performance and adjust learning rate.

Trained for up to 30 epochs with batch_size=3
